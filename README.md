# Intelligent-smart-phone-controller
Smart phones are now very common devices to have. Nowadays Smart phones are replacing the tradition mobile phones. Smart phone controlling is one of the leading concepts of android application. Sometimes we need to access the smart phone remotely and get the contents of the phone. The information should be sent with the least cost and efficiently.

Smart phones are costlier than the ordinary phones. We sometimes leave the phone on table of a restaurant by hurry or negligence, so need an assistant or something like that to alert us to take the phone. 

So to achieve the above two concept the “An Intelligent Smart Phone Controller” which will be an android application will be helpful. It will give and assistant support and also remote accessing to the user.

--- Objective and Goals
There are several remote accessing applications available in the android market, but all those application needs an active internet facility. Those applications also need a smart phone to access another smart phone. And they have their own disadvantages. 
So the objective is to develop an android application which helps to access the smart phone through a different non smart phone, and also to use simple SMS service available in the mobile. Another objective is that application must be installed only in smart phone and no need to install anything in the remote phone.

---- Proposed System
To overcome the above mentioned disadvantage here is an alternate proposal for solving the above problem through an android application which does not need an active internet connection. Here the information is accessed through the normal Messages and the application is activated through the message. Before allowing the remote user to access the phone, the application does some authentication process. 
	
In addition to the remote accessing we have a mobile remainder utility through which we can minimize the rate of losing the smart phone. Here we are going to use a Bluetooth device which will be in continuous contact with the paired smart phone, if the connection is lost then the Bluetooth device starts to vibrate. Again if connection is gained then the vibration stops indicating that the smart phone is near the user. 
	
-----Features
	Some of the features of the proposed android application are,
	Accessing the contacts of the smart phone from the remote phone through messages.
	Accessing the missed calls of the smart phone from the remote phone through messages.
	Accessing the messages of the smart phone from the remote phone through messages.
	Remotely ringing the smart phone when it is silent mode through simple message.
	Changing the profile of the smart phone through simple messages.
	Getting the location of the smart phone remotely through message.
	Connecting and pairing with the external Bluetooth device for Bluetooth reminder.
